  textsIntro:
  - FINALLY it's not early, hello friend, I'm MOODY, MOODY the cactus and yeah dude
    im a cactus !
  - What do you mean you've never seen a talking cactus? Well I have to admit that
    I haven't moved from here in a long time...
  - I have to say that she warned me that if I touched her she would make me stagnate
    in a simulation or something like that ....
  - Anyway, I'm a real chatterbox, sorry, let's start again, I'm MOODY glad to meet
    you, buddy!
  - You're doing fine ? So you're helping me out yea ? It's not very funny to be
    stuck here for months and months without being able to see the light of day...
  - 'Seriously I''ve been stuck next to this pc for ages it''s inhuman to do this
    kind of thing ! '
  - So to get me out of here you're going to use this console. It will allow you
    to get us to the next room since the door behind you is closed.
  textsStep1:

    relationship.
